# subs

A terminal-based YouTube subscription manager.

## Architecture

Three packages in a monorepo: `api` is a NestJS backend backed by PostgreSQL that fetches videos from YouTube RSS feeds. `cli` is a React Ink terminal UI compiled to a standalone binary. `contracts` holds the shared ts-rest API types used by both.

## Running the API

Requires a PostgreSQL database.

```bash
docker run \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/db" \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/frankmarazita/subs:latest
```

The container runs migrations automatically on startup.

## Running the CLI

Download the `subs` binary from the latest CI artifact, or build it yourself:

```bash
bun run --filter cli build
# outputs: packages/cli/subs
```

Run it:

```bash
./subs
```

By default it connects to the API at `http://localhost:3000`. Override via config (see below).

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.config/subs/config.json`:

```json
{
  "userPreferences": {
    "thumbnailPreview": true,
    "autoRefresh": true
  },
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

The CLI watches this file for live changes.

## Managing subscriptions

Via the API:

```bash
# Add a channel (any YouTube URL format)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/subscriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/@channelname"}'

# Import from Google Takeout CSV
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/subscriptions/import-csv \
  -H "Content-Type: text/csv" \
  --data-binary @subscriptions.csv

# Export to CSV
curl http://localhost:3000/subscriptions/export-csv
```
